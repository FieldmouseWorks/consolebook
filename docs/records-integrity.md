# Records Integrity

Training records may be used in personnel decisions, grievances, audits, and litigation. The data model must preserve what was documented, by whom, under which rules, and what happened afterward.

## Draft and finalized states

Draft content is mutable. Draft edits and ownership transfers remain attributable.

Finalization creates an immutable EvaluationVersion. Application code must never update finalized content in place while it is retained.

A correction produces a successor version linked to the original with an explicit reason and authority. Both versions remain available until an authorized retention workflow disposes of them.

## Canonical bytes

The canonical byte representation is part of the record format and was fixed
before the first finalized record by ADR 0011.

Consolebook uses canonical JSON with RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme
semantics and a deliberately closed value subset:

- UTF-8 encoding;
- deterministic object-member ordering;
- deterministic number serialization;
- no insignificant whitespace;
- a versioned envelope identifying the canonicalization and record-schema versions;
- integers with magnitude below 2^53; and
- no floating-point values or non-ASCII object-member names.

Hashes are calculated over the specified canonical bytes, never over incidental
serializer output. Golden vectors in
`crates/consolebook-server/tests/canonical_format.rs` pin the serializer.

## Stable fingerprints

Every finalized version receives a SHA-256 content hash.

Every version also carries the domain-separated integrity-chain hash fixed by
ADR 0011:

```text
SHA-256(
  "consolebook-version-v1" ||
  0x00 ||
  predecessor_content_hash ||
  canonical_record_bytes
)
```

The predecessor is the prior version's raw 32-byte content hash, or 32 zero
bytes for a first version. Golden vectors cover both cases.

This chain detects corruption, incomplete history, buggy writes, and lazy tampering. Someone with arbitrary database-write access can recompute a database-local chain, so the product must not describe the chain alone as strong tamper evidence.

## Signatures

A future stronger mode may sign version hashes with an installation Ed25519 key stored outside SQLite with operating-system access controls.

The public key and signature metadata would accompany structured exports and
PDFs. Key creation, rotation, backup, recovery, and compromise handling remain
deferred pending a separate design.

Canonicalization allows signatures to be added later without redefining a
record.

## Historical presentation snapshots

Finalized versions cannot depend on mutable joins for their meaning. They preserve the values required to reproduce the record, including:

- displayed names and identifiers;
- role or title when relevant;
- program and phase labels;
- competency and task text;
- rating labels and definitions;
- form instructions;
- timezone and local-time representation.

Template and font version pinning belongs to the planned PDF implementation.

Stable IDs preserve identity. Snapshots preserve what the record said.

## Attachments

The canonical envelope reserves an attachments member, currently empty.
Attachment content, cryptographic hashes, immutable metadata, replacement
behavior, malware scanning, content-type validation, size limits, and export
behavior remain Milestone 5 design and implementation work.

## Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments bind to one immutable EvaluationVersion. They are separate records so receipt, disagreement, refusal, and escalation do not alter the authored evaluation.

An amendment never inherits acknowledgment silently.

## Retention, holds, and lawful disposition

Immutability governs records while they are retained. It does not overrule an approved records-retention schedule or authorize keeping personal data forever.

Policy and hold administration is implemented in ADR 0020. The complete
disposition workflow remains [#64](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/consolebook/issues/64):

1. a versioned policy identifies the record class, disposition authority, trigger, retention period, and action;
2. the service checks for litigation, anticipated-litigation, audit, investigation, public-records-request, and other configured holds;
3. an authorized operator reviews the exact scope and authority before confirming disposition;
4. content, attachments, historical presentation snapshots, indexes, and derived exports in scope are destroyed; and
5. the operation records success or failure without copying the destroyed content into an audit message.

Where the applicable policy permits or requires it, a minimal DispositionEvent acts as a tombstone. It may retain the former version hash, opaque identifiers, record class and date range, disposition authority, actor or approver, timestamp, method, result, and a non-sensitive reason code. Its own retention is independently configured.

A retained hash can preserve chain continuity and show that a known version was disposed of under stated authority. It cannot prove deleted bytes still match that hash. Verification must report the version as lawfully disposed and unavailable for content verification, never quietly claim a complete recheck.

Some schedules may require destruction of metadata that another schedule would preserve. In that case the chain closes at a signed or exported checkpoint, and later verification reports the intentional policy boundary. Cryptography does not get a special exemption from retention law.

## Audit trail

The audit trail records actions around the record: viewing where policy requires it, submission, finalization, acknowledgment, refusal, export, authorization changes, backup, and restore.

Audit events and disposition events need their own retention and integrity rules. They do not replace immutable record versions, and they must not smuggle destroyed record content into a longer-lived table.

## Verification

Current automated evidence includes canonicalization and hash golden vectors,
database tests proving finalized rows reject mutation, amendment and
acknowledgment binding tests, file-only structured-export and trainee-packet
verification, backup validation, and tests of the stopped-server restore path.

Before the first production-capable release, Consolebook still needs:

- hold and lawful-disposition tests, including partial failure and retry behavior;
- verification tests for retained tombstones and policy-required chain closure;
- deterministic PDF fixtures within defined tolerances;
- attachment integrity and export tests; and
- recorded clean-installation restore drills beyond the automated restore-path
  tests.
