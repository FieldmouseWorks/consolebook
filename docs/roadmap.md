# Roadmap

The roadmap is ordered by risk. Dates come later; fake schedules are how software projects begin lying to themselves.

**Current position:** Milestones 0 through 4 are complete. Milestone 0
closed with ADR 0011's canonical-record-bytes specification, delivered
with Milestone 4's first slice; Milestone 4 — defensible records —
closed with #32's four slices (#36, #38, #40, #42): canonical bytes
and immutable finalized versions with completion rules, acknowledgments
and the trainee timeline, amendments and successor versions
(ADR 0012), and weekly summaries with task signoffs (ADR 0013, record
schema 2). Milestone 5 is in progress under #44. Its first two slices are
complete: file-verifiable structured record exports (#46, ADR 0014) and
complete trainee packets (#50, ADR 0015). Slice 3 — retention policy,
holds, lawful disposition, tombstones, and explicit authority — is tracked in
[#64](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/consolebook/issues/64). Its administration
stage (#65, ADR 0020) provides policy versions, holds, and explicit administration
authority. Confirmed disposition, backup/restore scope, tombstones, and portable
policy-boundary evidence remain next.

For continuation, start with the approved design in
[#44](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/consolebook/issues/44) and check the
[open issues](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/consolebook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
and current PR reviews. The [2026-09-05 audit](audits/2026-09-05.md) records
verification, known gaps, and recommended sequencing at that revision; it is
not a substitute for live issue state.

## Milestone 0 — Foundation

- establish principles and architecture decisions;
- define public domain vocabulary;
- create a buildable Rust workspace;
- publish the AGPL-3.0-only license and contribution terms;
- define contribution and security-reporting paths; and
- specify canonical record bytes.

**Exit:** the project can explain what it is building and what it refuses to become.

## Milestone 1 — Operable shell

- command-line configuration;
- first-run setup code;
- local administrator creation;
- administrator-issued password reset and sole-administrator local recovery;
- embedded SvelteKit shell for setup, sign-in, recovery, status, and in-app notices;
- SQLite migrations and explicit connection invariants;
- health and `doctor` commands;
- structured logging without sensitive record content; and
- automatic validated backups with a tested restore path.

**Exit:** an empty installation can initialize, restart, back up, restore, and diagnose itself.

## Milestone 2 — Versioned program configuration

- programs and immutable program versions;
- phases and non-linear transitions;
- competencies, tasks, forms, and rating scales;
- publishing and enrollment pinning; and
- configuration export/import; and
- web interface for authoring, comparing, publishing, and enrolling program versions.

**Exit:** a complete invented training program can be published, enrolled, exported, and reproduced.

## Milestone 3 — Sessions and drafts

- users, capabilities, and assignment-scoped access;
- enrollments and phase history;
- training sessions with explicit time semantics;
- daily evaluation drafts;
- contributor and ownership-transfer history;
- manual and automatic draft persistence; and
- review/change-request workflow;
- persisted in-app workflow notices; and
- trainer and coordinator web interface for sessions, drafts, assignments, and review.

**Exit:** trainers can document an invented session collaboratively without losing attribution.

## Milestone 4 — Defensible records

- canonical record format;
- immutable finalized versions;
- rating and narrative rules;
- weekly summaries linked to daily versions;
- acknowledgments, responses, and refusals;
- amendments and successor versions;
- trainee timeline and acknowledgment, response, refusal, and escalation interface;
- append-only audit events; and
- database-enforced immutability.

**Exit:** the full lifecycle is reproducible and mutation attempts fail closed.

## Milestone 5 — Exports and recovery

- deterministic PDF records;
- complete structured exports;
- trainee packet generation;
- attachment integrity;
- retention-policy administration, record holds, lawful disposition, and destruction logs;
- scheduled backup retention;
- restore verification; and
- operator documentation; and
- operator interface for export, hold, disposition, backup, and restore workflows.

**Exit:** a center can leave with all of its data and can prove recovery from a clean installation.

## Milestone 6 — Pilot hardening

- accessibility and usability review;
- keyboard, screen-reader, error-recovery, and responsive-layout proof across every shipped workflow;
- threat modeling;
- privacy review;
- performance and concurrency tests;
- migration compatibility policy;
- deployment packages for common environments; and
- external security assessment.

**Exit:** explicit owner acceptance and real recovery evidence support a production-readiness decision.

## Held until justified

- OIDC;
- optional SMTP notification delivery;
- installation-level signing keys;
- hosted instance management;
- advanced analytics;
- integrations with external personnel systems; and
- configurable custom roles.

These are valid future capabilities. None gets to infect migration `0001` merely because it sounds enterprise-shaped.
