# Development Guide

This map routes contributors and agents to the implementation and its
authorities. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) owns repository rules;
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns build gates and contribution workflow.

## Choose context by task

Read the relevant row, then the specific service, migration, and test involved.
ADRs record decisions; format documents specify portable bytes; source and
tests show what is implemented. [Roadmap](roadmap.md) owns milestone status.

`lib.rs` exposes the library modules. Integration tests in
`crates/consolebook-server/tests/` are named by capability; migration files in
`crates/consolebook-server/migrations/` own schema, constraints, and triggers.
Read both when changing a persisted contract.

Packet membership and timeline verification tests live in
`tests/trainee_packet/pin_history.rs`; the parent packet test module owns
shared fixtures and archive-editing helpers.

`tests/enrollment_event_schema.rs` covers fresh and upgraded lifecycle-event
storage, retained-history preservation, and fail-closed migration of malformed
legacy rows. ADR 0018 explains the migration 0014 diagnostic and repair boundary.

## Runtime flow

```text
Svelte route -> web/src/lib/api.ts -> /api/* HTTP adapter
             -> domain service -> SQLx -> SQLite constraints and triggers
```

`main.rs` owns the CLI. `serve` resolves the data directory, acquires the serve
lock, opens and migrates SQLite, verifies connection invariants, starts the
backup scheduler, and serves Axum. `http.rs` owns router registration, the
current-user extractor, and error translation. Larger handler groups live in
`programs_http.rs`, `training_http.rs`, `drafts_http.rs`, and `exports_http.rs`.
Policy belongs in services; persisted constraints also have database backstops.
`audit.rs` owns typed audit events; `notices.rs` owns recipient-scoped notices.

`sessions.rs` owns login sessions; `training_sessions.rs` owns periods of
training. Do not infer policy from a role name or a UI guard.

Application-owned write transactions use `storage::write_tx` and await rollback
on refusal through `storage::refuse` (or directly for outcome/optional returns).
Read-only snapshots remain deferred. [ADR 0019](decisions/0019-immediate-write-transactions.md)
owns the transaction discipline and contention limits; `tests/write_transactions.rs`
and its domain child modules own concurrency proof.

`programs.rs` owns policy and transaction orchestration; `programs/content.rs`
owns configuration vocabulary and validation; `programs/persistence.rs` owns
content persistence and caller-transaction inserts. Public imports remain under
`programs`.
A transaction's presence alone does not prove authorization shares its
snapshot; check where the decision is evaluated. See the
[domain-model qualification](domain-model.md#application-service-invariants).

## Web map

The UI is a client-routed SPA. `web/src/routes/+layout.ts` guards setup and
authentication; `+layout.svelte` owns navigation and shared styling.
`web/src/lib/api.ts` owns typed same-origin HTTP calls.
`web/src/lib/editor/` contains program-authoring components.

`web/e2e/fixtures.ts` supplies each scenario's server, base URL, and setup code.
`server.ts` owns process startup and scratch-data cleanup; `server.spec.ts`
checks startup failures, listener ownership, and shutdown. Keep scenario data
and assertions in their own specs.

| Route | Ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `/setup`, `/login`, `/reset` | Installation and authentication entry |
| `/` | Capability-sensitive status, notices, administration, session/review queues, installation exports |
| `/programs/**` | Program authoring, comparison, publishing, enrollment |
| `/enrollments/[id]` | Lifecycle, assignments, sessions, summaries, signoffs, exports |
| `/drafts/[id]` | Authoring, review, finalized presentation, acknowledgment, amendments |
| `/records` | Trainee's own timeline and packet downloads |

## Local workflow

From the repository root:

```sh
(cd web && npm ci && npm run build)
cargo run -p consolebook-server -- --data-dir ./data serve
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:7770> on the same machine. For a fresh installation,
use the setup code printed by the server, create invented agency/admin data,
then sign in. Use a separate empty data directory for a disposable preview.
The published preview already occupies port 7770 on its host; choose another
`serve --bind 127.0.0.1:PORT` there.

For live UI editing, run `npm run dev` in `web/` with a local Rust server.
`vite.config.ts` proxies `/api` to port 7770; adjust the target when using a
different local port. Check that target before using the dev UI on a shared
host. `npm run preview` alone serves static files without that API proxy.

`web_assets.rs` uses the build in `web/build/`: release builds embed it;
debug builds read it from disk. A missing build serves the explicit
"interface not embedded" notice. Rebuild web then Rust for release packaging.
Node.js is never required by the deployed binary.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#build-and-verification) for the full
verification sequence and browser prerequisites.
`cargo run -p consolebook-server -- --help` lists CLI operations;
`export verify <archive>` reads a file without opening an installation.
