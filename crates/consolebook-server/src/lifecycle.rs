//! Enrollment lifecycle and phase history (ADR 0008; docs/domain-model.md
//! `Enrollment`, `PhaseTransition`).
//!
//! Both histories are append-only event streams; migration 0006 makes the
//! database refuse edits, an unmediated version repoint, and phase
//! references outside the enrollment's pinned version. This module owns
//! the state derived from the streams (status, current phase, paused) and
//! the service-level rules the schema cannot express: the transition
//! graph, the pause state machine, required reasons, and effective-order
//! append.
//!
//! Phase events carry an effective instant (when the transition took
//! effect) and a recorded instant (when it was written). Backfill is
//! honest — both instants are kept and ordering uses the effective one —
//! but events append in effective order: an event that would land between
//! two already-recorded events is refused rather than silently reordering
//! history.
