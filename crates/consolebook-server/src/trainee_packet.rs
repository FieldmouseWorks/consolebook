//! Trainee packets (ADR 0015; docs/formats/trainee-packet.md; #48):
//! everything retained about one enrollment, as one archive.
//!
//! A packet is a record export's units — every retained version of every
//! record of the enrollment, byte for byte as `record_export` writes
//! them — plus typed documents for what the units do not carry: the
//! enrollment's lifecycle and phase history, every acknowledgment, every
//! amendment, and the full task signoff history. One packet manifest
//! names all of it with hashes. Every component is read from one
//! database snapshot, so a packet never mixes states; every stored
//! discriminator is parsed into its closed set, so a document's `kind`
//! is a vocabulary, not a string. Production follows the read rules
//! that exist (the trainee on their own enrollment, whoever may read the
//! training history, `export_records`); `export_verify` checks a packet
//! from its bytes alone.
